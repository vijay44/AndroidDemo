# MobileAppAutomationTest

Dear candidate,

🎈 Welcome to the mobile test challenge.

As a talented QA engineer, your task is to write pretty and stable Android UI tests with [**Espresso**](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso/index.html) for the given Android source code / app.

✏️ **Task**:
* Login case (username: ***whiteelephant261***, password: ***video***).
* Search for "***sa***", select "***Sarah Friedrich***" from results, then click the call button.
* Deploy the tests on [**CircleCI**](https://circleci.com/).

📖 **Rules**:
* The only rule is to use Espresso ☕ ;)
* Don't worry if you have no Espresso experience, we believe that you're a fast learner, and we'd like to give you enough time to finish this challenge.
* You can choose either Java or Kotlin, whatever you prefer.
* Try your best to apply best practice when writing test code.
* Feel free to touch the product's source code, apply any necessary change (for testability, fixing bug or improving code).
* Think big, what possible scenarios should be tested if the app has various kinds of users?  You don't have to code this, just show your thoughts in plain text.
* QA engineers don't only work with developers, but also closely collaborate with product managers.  It would be great if you have a strong product sense, you're welcome to spot any UX issues in this demo app and write it down.

💪 Roll up your sleeves and have fun 😊
